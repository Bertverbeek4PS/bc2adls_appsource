## Task Completion Checklist
- Rebuild the AL app (`AL: Package`) to validate object references/syntax.
- Update/refresh translation files if base captions change; regenerate `.g.xlf` when needed.
- Run any available automated tests (none observed in this repo; coordinate with external test app if applicable).
- Keep object IDs within 11344437-11344456 and affix ADL when adding new objects.
- Commit/push with clear summary once validation passes.
